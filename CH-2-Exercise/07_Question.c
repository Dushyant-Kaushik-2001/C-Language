Ques.7. Whether C language is a high level or low level programming language?

Ans. The C language is often referred to as a middle-level programming language because it bridges the gap between high-level and 
low-level programming languages.

The C language is considered a middle-level programming language because it provides features of both high-level and low-level languages:
High-level features make it user-friendly and portable.
Low-level features give it the power and efficiency needed for system-level programming.
This unique combination has made C one of the most influential and widely used programming languages.

Why C is Middle-Level?

1. System Programming = C is used to write operating systems, compilers, and embedded systems, which require close interaction with hardware.

2. Application Programming = C can also be used for application-level tasks like creating games or GUI applications.
