Ques.10. State the following statement as true or false -”Every block of code is a function”

Ans. The statement "Every block of code is a function" is false.

Not every block of code is a function. 
A block of code can refer to any section of code that is grouped together but a function specifically refers to a block of code that is 
defined with the intention of performing a specific task and can be called or invoked. 
Functions typically have a name, parameters, and return values, whereas other blocks of code, like loops, conditionals, or just plain 
statements, are not considered functions
