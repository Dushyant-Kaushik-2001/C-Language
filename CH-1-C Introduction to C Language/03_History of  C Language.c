---------------------------------------------------History of C Language-----------------------------------------------------------------

1. BCPL (Basic Combined Programming Language) was developed by Martin Richards in 1966.

2. Taking inspiration from BCPL, Ken Thompson has developed B language in 1969.Objective was to create UNIX operating system.  

3. Dennis Ritchie developed C language by making improvements in B language in 1972 at AT & Tâ€™s Bell Laboratory,New Jersy,USA.  

4. UNIX was rewritten in C language.Ritchie and Thompson are co-developers of UNIX.

5. The C programming language has a rich history that has greatly influenced modern programming languages.


*****************************************************History of C Language****************************************************************

History of C language is interesting to know. Here we are going to discuss a brief history of the c language:

1. C programming language was developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at bell laboratories of AT&T (American Telephone & Telegraph), located 
in the U.S.A.

2. Dennis Ritchie is known as the founder of the c language.

3. It was developed to overcome the problems of previous languages such as B, BCPL, etc.

4. Initially, C language was developed to be used in UNIX operating system. 
It inherits many features of previous languages such as B and BCPL.

5. Let's see the programming languages that were developed before C language:
