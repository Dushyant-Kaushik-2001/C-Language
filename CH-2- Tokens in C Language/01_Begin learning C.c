------------------------------------------------------Begin Learning C-------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Computer languages are like natural languages. 
Natural languages like Hindi, English, and German are used for the communication between human beings. 
Computer languages are used to prepare a script to perform actions by the machines. 

2. Language is just a medium to express our thoughts. When we want to say something to a machine to do some task, we just trigger the 
script (program) by clicking on some file or clicking on some button or may be hitting some key on the keyboard. 
This script or program is prepared in some computer programming language.
  
3. Developing program is the job of programmer. We need to learn language to become a programmer. 

4. Learning steps are very similar to the process we must have gone through at early stages of our schooling.
When we were a kid, we were supposed to learn alphabets in English. Swar and vyanjan in Hindi. 
In the same way we have to begin learning C language.

* Following are the steps: 
Step 1. Learn basic letters used in C language 
Step 2. Learn Tokens
Step 3. Learn Instructions (Statements or Commands) 
Step 4. Develop programs

Note = We are already familiar with the basic letters as we have seen them on keyboard. 
So we should start our journey of learning from Tokens.
