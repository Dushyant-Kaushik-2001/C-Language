-----------------------------------------------------What is Computer?---------------------------------------------------------------------

Computer is an electronic device which takes input, process it and gives output.

1. Desktop computers, personal computers, laptops are general purpose computers.
A general-purpose computer is a type of computer designed to perform a wide variety of tasks and run many different types of programs.
These computers are versatile and can handle diverse applications, from simple calculations to complex simulations, depending on the
software installed.

2. Home appliances, electronic gadgets are also computers if a circuit containing program is embedded into them.
For example, digital camera, washing machine, digital watch etc. 
Devices like digital cameras, washing machines, and digital watches are considered types of computers,
but they are special-purpose computers rather than general-purpose computers.

3. Ceiling fan is not a computer as it is not an electronic device but it is an electrical device.
Electronic device kam power par kam karte hain jabki Electrical device jyada power par kaam karte hain.

4. Mobile phone , Calculator is also a computer Because it takes input, process it and gives output.


------------------------------------------------------What is 0 and 1?-------------------------------------------------------------------

1. There is nothing like 0 and 1 in computer. There is no physical significance of 0 and 1.
In computers, 0 and 1 represent the binary number system, which is the foundation of all digital computing. 
This system is used because computers operate using electrical signals that have two distinct states: on and off.

2. We can encode any information in the form of 0s and 1s. 
Whether it is an audio, text, video or images,we can convert them into series of 0s and 1s.

3. Computer hardware constitutes of many kind of memory devices to store information.
Such memory devices are Hard Drive, flash memory, RAM, CPU registers, etc.
Memory devices differ in technologies, but all have this common capability to store information.

4. Hard drive can store magnetic information in two states (North Pole upside or downside),
RAM has capacitors to store information in two states (charge in the capacitor is present or absent),
CPU registers or processor registers can also store information in two states (low volt and high volt).

5. We can encode any information in the form of 0s and 1s. Whether it is an audio, text, video or images,
we can convert them into series of 0s and 1s.

6. Any real world information in encoded form (0s and 1s) can be stored in computer memory devices.
As all memory devices can maintain two state of information, we can easily map one state with 0 and another state with 1.


-----------------------------------------------------What is Hardware?--------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Hardware is a comprehensive term for all of the physical parts of a computer, as distinguished from the data it contains or operates on,
and the software that provides instructions for the hardware to accomplish tasks.

2. Hardware is anything which is tangible in the computer system.

3. Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system that we can see, touch, and interact with. 
It encompasses all the tangible parts of a computer that work together to perform tasks.

4. Categories of Hardware:
Internal Hardware = Components inside the computer case, like the CPU, motherboard, RAM, and GPU.
External Hardware = Devices connected externally, like keyboards, monitors, and printers.

5. Difference Between Hardware and Software:
Hardware = The physical components of a computer.
Software = The instructions and programs that tell the hardware what to do.

6. Examples of Hardware in Everyday Use:
A smartphone's screen, battery, and processor are its hardware.
A car's GPS system includes hardware like screens and sensors.

7. In summary, hardware forms the physical backbone of a computer system, working with software to execute tasks and solve problems.


-----------------------------------------------------What is File?-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Data is stored in our computer, generally in hard drive. 
It is stored in files. We must have seen files in our computer.
They are audio files, video files, text files, image files, etc.

2. A file in computing is a digital container used to store data, 
such as text,images,videos,audio,programs or any other type of information. 
Files are fundamental to how computers organize and manage information.

3. Every file has a name and extension.
For example, 
Track01.mp3  is a file, where Track01 is name of the file and mp3 is extension of the file.
resume.docx (text file)
photo.jpg (image file)
report.pdf (document file)

4. File is a data bundle. Kind of data stored in the file can be interpreted by looking at file extension.
Like mp3 is for audio, jpg is for image, txt is for text, etc.

5. All file contains 0s and 1s, but there decoding depends on the file extension.
So the same sequence of 0s and 1s can be interpreted in multiple ways.
If it is stored in some text file then it is decoded as some character.

6. Purpose of Files:
Files are used to
Organize Data = Store information in a structured way for easy access.
Preserve Information = Keep data for long-term use or reference.
Share Information = Facilitate data exchange between systems or users.

7. Now we can observe files with the extensions exe. These are special files. 
Data in exe file, are instructions for the computer to perform a task. 

NOTE = Exe file or executable file is software.


-----------------------------------------------------What is Software?---------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Software is an executable file (Extension exe is windows operating system specific, for other OS extension may differ).

2. Software is a collection of instructions, data, or programs that tell a computer how to work. 
It is intangible and serves as the bridge between the hardware of a computer system and its user. 
Software enables a computer to perform specific tasks, solve problems, or interact with other software or hardware systems.

3. Types of Software:

(a) System Software:
System software is for the computer system, they might be software responsible to control hardware or any background task.Like software 
responsible for graphics is system software.
System Software manages the hardware and software resources of a computer.
Examples: Operating systems (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux), utilities (e.g., antivirus, file management tools).

(b) Application software:
Application software is for the users. It is developed to solve human problems. Like MS word is application software.
Application software is designed to perform specific tasks for the user.
Examples: Word processors (e.g., MS Word), web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox), media players, and games.

(c) Middleware:
Software that acts as a bridge between different systems, applications, or databases, facilitating communication and integration.
Examples: Database middleware, message brokers.

(D) Development Software:
Tools used by developers to create, debug, maintain, and manage other software and applications.
Examples: IDEs (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse), compilers, and version control systems (e.g., Git).


-----------------------------------------------------Program and Process------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Set of instructions is called a program.

2. Active state of a program is called process.


-----------------------------------------------------What is Operating system?-------------------------------------------------------------

1. Operating System is system software. 
Windows 8, Windows XP, Windows 10, Ubuntu, RedHat, Solaris, Macintosh, etc are all examples of operating system.

2. An Operating System (OS) is system software that manages a computer's hardware, software, and resources, 
while also providing services and an interface for users and applications. 
It acts as a bridge between the user and the computer's hardware, ensuring that different programs and devices work together seamlessly.

3. Operating system is essential software in our computer responsible to manage all resources (hardware and software), running programs,
memory management, file management, security and interaction with user.

4. It provides an interface between user and machine.
Jab hum computer start kar lete hain to hum kya dikhta hai Screen ye screen OS ka output hai.
jaise Restaurant mein uska menu card ki kya dish order krni hai bilkul vaise hi os ne bhi humko ek menu card dikhaya hai jismein hum 
select krte hai koi icon ki hume kha jaana hai kya karna hai .

5. It acts as a manager of the computer system.

6. In summary, the operating system is the backbone of any computer system, orchestrating its smooth functioning and making it accessible 
to users and applications.

NOTE = Bina OS ke hum apne computer mein koi software nhi chla sakte.
