-----------------------------------------------------WHAT IS C?--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

1. C is a programming language. 
2. C is one of the oldest and finest programming languages. 
3. C was developed by Dennis Ritchie at AT&T’s Bell labs, USA in 1972.
4. C ek general-purpose programming language hai jo Dennis Ritchie ne 1972 mein banayi thi. 
Ye fast, efficient aur hardware ke close hoti hai, isiliye zyadatar operating systems (like UNIX) aur embedded systems me use hoti hai.


-----------------------------------------------------Features of C----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Simple and Powerful
2. Fast Execution
3. Low-Level Memory Access
4. Portable (Ek system se dusre pe chalti hai)
5. Rich Library Support


----------------------------------------------------Why Learn C Programming?-------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Programming ki foundation strong karegi.
2. Foundation language: C samajhne ke baad Other languages jaise C++, Java aur Python seekhna easy ho jaata hai.
3. Problem Solving Skills: Problem-solving aur logic banane ki skills develop hoti hain.
4. Embedded systems aur system-level programming me kaam aati hai.


-------------------------------------------------Why C language is so important?----------------------------------------------------------

**C language is very popular among programmers for its unique features and capabilities.Let’s first have a look to its fame: 
1. Oracle was written in C.
2. Core libraries of android are written in C.
3. MySQL is written in C.
4. Almost all device drivers are written in C.
5. Major part of web browser is written in C.
6. UNIX operating system was developed in C.
7. C language is ranked 1 on the basis of usage of language in the programming (present time).
 
These are some of the points to make we understand that C is not an outdated language.
Many students have this myth,they believe that C is out of industry,but it is not.
C is more popular in system level programming,hardware interaction,embedded systems and building core libraries of android.

**For a student C language is even more important,specially to build his career.Some of the reasons are:

1. C is important to build programming skills:
(a) If we are a beginner,C is ideal language to start with,and we can easily focus in developing our programming skills rather than getting 
confused in too many bookish concepts. 
(b) Language is just a medium of expressing our thoughts,so learning a language makes our capable to express our thoughts.
Language is for thoughts but thoughts are not depended on language.
Thinking about a solution to a particular problem is more important.
Language is required to express that solution only.
Programming is all about learning an art of developing solution to a problem.

2. C covers elementary language features of all programming language:
Language constructs are common in all programming languages like variables,data type,control statements,functions,arrays,strings,etc.
Once we have learnt all these concepts in C,it becomes easier to learn these concepts in another language.

3. Campus recruitment proces:
Companies take exams (written + interview) which may contain questions based on C language.Especially more important for fresher.

4. C is the most popular language for hardware dependent programming:
Students belongs to non-computer science branch should learn C language,because it has its part in integration with our core field.


-------------------------------------------------------USES OF C--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
C language is used to program a wide variety of systems.Some of the uses of are as follows: 

1. Major parts of Windows, Linux and other operating systems are written in C. 

2. C is used to write driver programs for devices like tablets, printers etc. 

3. C language is used to program embedded systems where programs need to run faster in limited memory(Microwave,Cameras etc.) 

4. C is used to develop games, an area where latency is very important,i.e.,the computer must react quickly to user input.
