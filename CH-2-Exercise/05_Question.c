Ques.5.Where variables are created? 
(RAM, ROM, Secondary Storage or CPU)

Ans. Variables are created in RAM (Random Access Memory) during the execution of a program. 

Ques. Why are Variables Stored in RAM?

Ans. RAM is used as the primary working memory of a computer.
It is fast and volatile, meaning it can quickly store and retrieve data while the program is running, but the data is lost when the 
computer is turned off.
Variables are part of the program's runtime, and their values need to be accessible for computations and processing.

Memory Type	                                                                        Role in Variable Storage
1. RAM	                                                                Primary location where variables are created and accessed.
2. ROM	                                                                Cannot store variables; used for permanent, unchangeable data.
3. Secondary Storage	                                                Stores program files, not variables during execution.
4. CPU Registers	                                                    Temporarily hold variable data for processing, but not for storage.
