Ques.6. What is the full form of ASCII?

Ans. The full form of ASCII is American Standard Code for Information Interchange.

Explanation:

1. American = It was developed in the United States and primarily reflects the English language's character set.
2. Standard = It provides a standardized way to represent text in computers and other devices.
3. Code = Refers to the numerical representation of characters.
4. Information Interchange = ASCII facilitates the exchange of text information between different systems and devices.

Key Details About ASCII:

1. ASCII is a 7-bit character encoding system, meaning it uses 7 bits to represent a character.
2. It defines 128 characters:
(a) 0–31: Control characters (e.g., NULL, BEL, ESC).
(b) 32–126: Printable characters (e.g., letters, digits, symbols, and space).
(c) 127: The DEL (delete) character.

Example:
Character	                                  ASCII Value
A	                                             65
a	                                             97
0	                                             48
Space	                                         32
Enter	                                         10 (Line Feed)

ASCII is widely used as a base for other encoding standards, such as UTF-8, which extends ASCII to support more characters from various 
languages.
