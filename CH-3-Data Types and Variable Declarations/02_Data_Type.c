---------------------------------------------------------Data Types--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Program needs data to process. Data comes in wide variety. 
Phone number is a data, name of a city, person name, account number, etc. are all data. 
Nature of one data is different from other, like we can add two numbers but cannot add two city names. 
Similarly, we can capitalize a string but the same operation cannot be applied to numbers.

2. In C, data types are used to define variables and their types during program execution. 
They specify the type of data that a variable can hold, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, etc.

3. C language provides few keywords which can be used to tell compiler what kind of data we want to handle.
 
The basis of this classification is:

(A) Kind of operation we can perform on that category of data is different from the kind of operation we can perform on data belongs to different category.

(B) Amount of space required to represent data in memory.

(C) Data Type:int,char,float,double,void.

(D) Data types are keywords can be used on various occasions to specify the kind of data. One use of data type is to declare variables.  

NOTE = Saare keywords data type nhi hai lekin ye kuch keywords hain jo data type hain.
Data type yaani data ki category.
