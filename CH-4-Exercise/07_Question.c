// Ques.7.Write a C program to print \\ on the screen.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <conio.h>
int main()
{
    printf("\\\\");
    getch();
}



/* 
Explanation:
1. In C, the backslash (\) is an escape character.
2. To print a single backslash (\), we need to escape it by typing \\.
3. Since we want to print two backslashes (\\), we need to type \\\\.
