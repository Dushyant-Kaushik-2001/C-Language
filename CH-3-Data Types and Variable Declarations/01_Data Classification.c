------------------------------------------------------Data Classification--------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Different data requires different way of handling data in computer.
Program needs data to process. Data comes in wide variety. 
Phone number is a data, name of a city, person name, account number, etc. are all data. 
Nature of one data is different from other, like we can add two numbers but cannot add two city names. 
Similarly, we can capitalize a string but the same operation cannot be applied to numbers.

2. C language provides few keywords which can be used to tell compiler what kind of data we want to handle.

3. Factors responsible for Data classification:

1. Memory size required to store data. 
Amount of space required to represent data in memory.

2. Method to convert data into binary for internal representation. 

3. Kind of operations performed on data. 
Kind of operation we can perform on that category of data is different from the kind of operation we can perform on data belongs to 
different category.
