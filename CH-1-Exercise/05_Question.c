Ques.5.What is the latest version of C Language?

Ans. C17
As of my last update, the most recent standard of the C language is C17 (also known as ISO/IEC 9899:2018), 
which was officially published in 2018. 
There have been discussions about a newer version (often referred to as C2X), 
which aims to include further improvements and updates to the language,but it has not yet been officially released.
