Ques.1. Which of the following are real constants?
3, ‘A’, 4.5, 3.0, ‘+’, -25, -0.0

Ans. 
The real constants in our list are: 4.5, 3.0, -0.0
These are all valid real constants in C.

In C programming, real constants (also called floating-point constants) refer to numbers that represent real values, 
typically with a decimal point or in scientific notation. 
These constants can be either of type float or double and are used to represent fractional values.

Let's analyze each of the values you provided:

1. 3
Not a real constant: This is an integer constant, not a real constant. 
Real constants must have a decimal point or be represented in scientific notation.
2. ‘A’
Not a real constant: This is a character constant, representing the character A. It is not a numeric value, so it's not a real constant.
3. 4.5
Real constant: This is a valid real constant, as it has a decimal point.
4. 3.0
Real constant: This is also a valid real constant. Though it may appear as a whole number with a decimal point, it is still a real constant.
5. ‘+’
Not a real constant: This is a character constant, representing the + character. It's not a numeric value, so it is not a real constant.
6. -25
Not a real constant: This is an integer constant (even though it is negative). It lacks a decimal point, so it's not a real constant.
7. -0.0
Real constant: This is a valid real constant. The negative sign does not change the fact that this is a real constant because it has a decimal point.
