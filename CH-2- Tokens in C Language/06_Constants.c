----------------------------------------------------------Constant------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Any information is constant. Every program we make is to process data.

For example, program to add two numbers or calculate simple interest, etc. We need some data to process. 
In addition of two numbers program, we need two numbers to perform task. 
Similarly, in simple interest program we need principle, time and rate of interest information, and then only we can process it. 
In a nut shell, this data is called constant.

2. Data = Information = Constant 

Information or constant can be classified which gives us ease of handling data in our program. 
Number is a constant, our name is also constant but we cannot perform multiplication between two names. 
So data can be categorized on the basis of kind of operations we can perform on it and on internal binary representation.  

3. In C, a constant is a value that does not change during the execution of a program. 
Constants are fixed values that are assigned at compile time. 
They can be of various data types such as integer, float, character, or string.

4. In c language constants are classified as:

(A). Primary constants = Integer,Real,Character.

(B). Secondary constants = Array,string,Pointers,Structure,Union,Enumerator.

5.. Numbers without decimal points are known as integers. 
Example: -55,25,0

*Note = Hmara mobile number integer constant hai jabki hmare mobile ka balance real constant hai.

6.. Numbers with decimal point are known as real constants.
Example: 21.4,3.56,-0.065,2.0

*Note = C language ke andar 2 likhna aur 2.0 likhna alg alg baatein hain 2 integer hai aur 2.0 real constant.

7.. Any symbol (only one Symbol) in single quotes is known as character constant.
Example: 'a', 'B',  '+',  '',  '2'

Note= '-3' characater constant nhi hai kyunki character constant ki ye sharat hai ki usmeim ek hi character hona chaiye 
-3 mein (-) ek symbol hai aur 3 doosra symbol hai.
