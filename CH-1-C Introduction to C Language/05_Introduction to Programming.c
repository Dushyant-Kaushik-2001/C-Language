--------------------------------------------------What is a Software?-------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Software ek program hota hai jo computer ko chalane aur kaam karne ke liye instructions deta hai. 
2. Bina software ke, computer sirf ek dabba (hardware) hai, jo kuch bhi nahi kar sakta.
3. Software is an executable file (Extension exe is windows operating system specific, for other OS extension may differ).
4. Software is a collection of instructions, data, or programs that tell a computer how to work. 
5. It is intangible and serves as the bridge between the hardware of a computer system and its user. 
6. Software enables a computer to perform specific tasks, solve problems, or interact with other software or hardware systems.
7. Types of Software:

(a) System Software:
System software is for the computer system, they might be software responsible to control hardware or any background task.Like software 
responsible for graphics is system software.
System Software manages the hardware and software resources of a computer.
Examples: Operating systems (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux), utilities (e.g., antivirus, file management tools).

(b) Application software:
Application software is for the users. It is developed to solve human problems. Like MS word is application software.
Application software is designed to perform specific tasks for the user.
Examples: Word processors (e.g., MS Word), web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox), media players, and games.

(c) Middleware:
Software that acts as a bridge between different systems, applications, or databases, facilitating communication and integration.
Examples: Database middleware, message brokers.

(D) Development Software:
Tools used by developers to create, debug, maintain, and manage other software and applications.
Examples: IDEs (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse), compilers, and version control systems (e.g., Git).


-------------------------------------------------Why We Need a Software?-------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Computer ko chalane ke liye:  
(a). Jaise ek car ko chalane ke liye driver chahiye, waise hi computer ko chalane ke liye software chahiye.
(b). Example: Windows, macOS, ya Android.

2. Kaam karne ke liye: 
(a). Har kaam ke liye ek software hota hai.
(b). For Example: 
Typing karne ke liye = MS Word.
Photos edit karne ke liye = Photoshop.
Movies dekhne ke liye = VLC Player.
Internet chalane ke liye = Browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).

3. Samajhne aur samjhane ke liye:
(a). Software user aur computer ke beech translator ka kaam karta hai.
(b). User jo type karta hai ya karna chahta hai, software use computer ko samjhata hai.

4. Data ko store aur manage karne ke liye:
(a). Software data ko save karne aur wapas nikalne ka kaam karta hai.
(b). Example: Mobile ke gallery app me photos store hoti hain.

5. Communication ke liye:
Software ke bina Hum email, WhatsApp ya video call nahi kar sakte.

6. Hardware aur Software ka relation:
Hardware ek body hai, aur software uska dimaag.
Agar dimaag nahi hoga, toh body kaise chalegi?

7. Conclusion:
Software hume computer aur mobile devices ke saath kaam karne aur unhe samajhne layak banata hai.Bina software ke computer useless hai.


-----------------------------------------------------What is File?-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Data is stored in our computer, generally in hard drive. It is stored in files. We must have seen files in our computer.
They are audio files, video files, text files, image files, etc.

2. A file in computing is a digital container used to store data, such as text,images,videos,audio,programs or any other type of information. 
Files are fundamental to how computers organize and manage information.

3. Every file has a name and extension.
For example, 
Track01.mp3  is a file, where Track01 is name of the file and mp3 is extension of the file.
resume.docx (text file)
photo.jpg (image file)
report.pdf (document file)

4. File is a data bundle. Kind of data stored in the file can be interpreted by looking at file extension.
Like mp3 is for audio, jpg is for image, txt is for text, etc.

5. All file contains 0s and 1s, but there decoding depends on the file extension.
So the same sequence of 0s and 1s can be interpreted in multiple ways.
If it is stored in some text file then it is decoded as some character.

6. Purpose of Files:
Files are used to
Organize Data = Store information in a structured way for easy access.
Preserve Information = Keep data for long-term use or reference.
Share Information = Facilitate data exchange between systems or users.

7. Now we can observe files with the extensions exe. These are special files. 
Data in exe file, are instructions for the computer to perform a task. 

NOTE = Exe file or executable file is software.


-----------------------------------------------------What is Hardware?--------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Hardware is a comprehensive term for all of the physical parts of a computer, as distinguished from the data it contains or operates on,
and the software that provides instructions for the hardware to accomplish tasks.

2. Hardware is anything which is tangible in the computer system.

3. Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system that we can see, touch, and interact with. 
It encompasses all the tangible parts of a computer that work together to perform tasks.

4. Categories of Hardware:
Internal Hardware = Components inside the computer case, like the CPU, motherboard, RAM, and GPU.
External Hardware = Devices connected externally, like keyboards, monitors, and printers.

5. Difference Between Hardware and Software:
Hardware = The physical components of a computer.
Software = The instructions and programs that tell the hardware what to do.

6. Examples of Hardware in Everyday Use:
A smartphone's screen, battery, and processor are its hardware.
A car's GPS system includes hardware like screens and sensors.

7. In summary, hardware forms the physical backbone of a computer system, working with software to execute tasks and solve problems.


-----------------------------------------------------What is Operating system?-------------------------------------------------------------

1. Operating System is system software. 
Windows 8, Windows XP, Windows 10, Ubuntu, RedHat, Solaris, Macintosh, etc are all examples of operating system.

2. An Operating System (OS) is system software that manages a computer's hardware, software, and resources, 
while also providing services and an interface for users and applications. 
It acts as a bridge between the user and the computer's hardware, ensuring that different programs and devices work together seamlessly.

3. Operating system is essential software in our computer responsible to manage all resources (hardware and software), running programs,
memory management, file management, security and interaction with user.

4. It provides an interface between user and machine.
Jab hum computer start kar lete hain to hum kya dikhta hai Screen ye screen OS ka output hai.
jaise Restaurant mein uska menu card ki kya dish order krni hai bilkul vaise hi os ne bhi humko ek menu card dikhaya hai jismein hum 
select krte hai koi icon ki hume kha jaana hai kya karna hai .

5. It acts as a manager of the computer system.

6. In summary, the operating system is the backbone of any computer system, orchestrating its smooth functioning and making it accessible 
to users and applications.

NOTE = Bina OS ke hum apne computer mein koi software nhi chla sakte.


-------------------------------------------------------Program and Process------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Set of instructions is called a program.

2. Active state of a program is called process.
