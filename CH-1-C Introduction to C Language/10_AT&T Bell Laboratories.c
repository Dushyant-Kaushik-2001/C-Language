---------------------------------------------------------AT & T's Bell Labs--------------------------------------------------------------------

1. American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T).

2. Alexander Graham Bell ne 1885 mein AT&T ko start kiya tha.

3. AT&T was Founded in 1885.

4. AT&T ne telephones, telephone lines, aur communication technology develop ki.

5. AT&T ke Bell Labs ek research center the, jahan pe bohot saare inventions hue.

6. Bell Labs ne UNIX aur C programming language jaise bohot bade inventions kiye.

7. 90s mein AT&T ne Bell Labs ko alag company bana diya, jiska naam Lucent Technologies tha.

8. Lucent Technologies ne 2006 mein Alcatel ke saath merge kiya.

9. Aaj Nokia Bell Labs ke naam se jaana jaata hai.

10. Bell Labs ke scientists ko 9 Nobel Prizes mile hain, jaise:
(a). Transistor invention ke liye (1956).
(b). Big Bang ke evidence ke liye (1978).
(c). Quantum optics ke kaam ke liye (1997).

11. Language develped at Bell Labs:
B, C, C++, S, SNOBOL, AWK, AMPL and the Unix operating system. 

12. It was Acquired by Nokia in 2016.

13. Bell Labs, jo AT&T Bell Labs ke naam se bhi jaana jaata hai, ek research center hai jahan pe bohot bade inventions hue hain. 
Yeh pehle AT&T company ke under tha, ab yeh Nokia Bell Labs ke naam se jaana jaata hai.

14. Aaj Bell Labs Nokia ke under kaam karta hai aur modern technologies par research kar raha hai, jaise:
(a). 5G Networks
(b). Artificial Intelligence (AI)
(c). Green Energy Solutions


---------------------------------------------------Bell Labs ke Inventions aur Achievements--------------------------------------------------

1. Transistor (1947):
Inventors = John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, aur William Shockley.
Transistor ek chhota electronic part hai jo computers, smartphones, aur modern electronics ka base hai.

2. UNIX Operating System (1969):
Creators = Ken Thompson aur Dennis Ritchie.
UNIX ka simple aur powerful design aaj ke operating systems (Linux, macOS, Android) ka base hai.

3. C Programming Language (1972):
Creator = Dennis Ritchie.
C ek programming language hai jo software aur operating systems banane ke liye use hoti hai. Aaj bhi C kaafi popular hai.

4. Information Theory (1948):
Founder = Claude Shannon.
Yeh theory aaj ke communication system ka foundation hai, jisme internet, mobile data, aur calls aate hain.

5. Solar Cell (1954):
Pehli baar Bell Labs ne ek practical solar cell banaya jo sunlight ko electricity mein convert karta tha.

6. Laser Technology (1958):
Yeh light technology medical, industrial aur communication systems mein use hoti hai.

7. Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (1964):
Bell Labs ke scientists ne "Big Bang Theory" ka proof diya.Iske liye unhe Nobel Prize mila.


-------------------------------------Bell Labs pulled out of the MULTICS project in 1969-----------------------------------------------------

Bell Labs ne 1969 mein MULTICS project se apna haath khinch liya,yeh ek important decision tha jo computing ke world mein bada change laaya.

--Kyu nikle Bell Labs MULTICS project se?

1. Cost Aur Complexity: Bell Labs ko laga ki MULTICS system bohot complex aur mehenga ho sakta hai. Iska design itna complicated tha ki 
unhone socha ki yeh project unke liye thoda zyada challenging ho sakta hai, especially in terms of time aur resources.

2. Alag Soch: Bell Labs ke engineers ka mindset thoda alag tha. Unhone simple aur effective design pe focus karna zyada pasand kiya, 
jabki MULTICS ka design kaafi complex aur integrated tha.

3. Goals Mein Farq: Bell Labs ka main kaam telecommunications aur hardware development par tha. 
MULTICS ka development unke liye utna relevant nahi tha, isliye unhone is project se alag hone ka decision liya.


----------------------------------------------------MULTICS se Niklne ke Baad Kya Hua?----------------------------------------------------

1. Ken Thomson decided to build his own operating system.

2. But Question was in which language?
Ken Thomson decided to build his own operating system in BCPL (Basic Combied Programmimg language).

3. BCPL is a programming Language and was developed by Martin Richards in 1966.

4. Ken Thomson started building his own operating system in BCPL.

5. But ken Thomson found that BCPL was not suitable for the project.

6. So, Ken Thomson decided to build his own language.

7. Taking inspiration from BCPL, Ken Thompson has developed B language in 1969. Objective was to create UNIX operating system.
why name is B? Because it was derived from BCPL and the work on B language was started after BCPL.

8. In 1972, Dennis Ritchie developed the compiled programming language C as a replacement for the interpreted language B.
Dennis Ritchie developed C language by making improvements in B language in 1972 at AT & Tâ€™s Bell Laboratory, New Jersy, USA.

9. UNIX operating system was written in B language first and then re-written in C.
UNIX was rewritten in C language. Ritchie and Thompson are co-developers of UNIX
