Ques.2.Which of the following are not keywords in C Language?
auto, dynamic, static, typedef, define, enum, is, default, this, super

Ans. 
The words that are not keywords in C are : dynamic, define, is, this, super
The other words (auto, static, typedef, enum, default) are all keywords in C.

In the C programming language, keywords are reserved words that have special meaning and functionality in the language. 
Keywords cannot be used as identifiers (such as variable names, function names, etc.).

Let's analyze the provided list:

1. auto
auto is a keyword in C, used to specify that a variable has automatic storage duration (though this is the default for local variables in 
modern C).

2. dynamic
dynamic is not a keyword in C. It is not used in C for any specific functionality.

3. static
static is a keyword in C, used to declare variables that retain their values between function calls or to limit the scope of a variable 
to the file or function in which it's declared.

4. typedef
typedef is a keyword in C, used to create new type definitions (e.g., for structs or other complex data types).

5. define
define is not a keyword. It is used by the preprocessor as part of the #define directive to define constants or macros, but it is not a 
part of the C language syntax itself.

6. enum
enum is a keyword in C, used to define enumerated types.

7. is
is is not a keyword in C. It is not used for any functionality in the language.

8. default
default is a keyword in C, used in switch statements to specify the default case when no other case matches.

9. this
this is not a keyword in C. It is used in C++ to refer to the current object in a class, but not in C.

10. super
super is not a keyword in C. It is used in object-oriented languages like Java to refer to the parent class or superclass.
