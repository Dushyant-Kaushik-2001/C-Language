a. Mobile number	                   String	               Mobile numbers are often stored as strings to handle leading zeros and prevent arithmetic operations.
b. Name of a city	                   String	               City names consist of text characters and are best represented as strings.
c. Rate of interest	                    Real	               Rates of interest can include decimal values (e.g., 3.5%), making them a real/float data type.
d. Number of family members	           Integer	               The count of family members is a whole number, so it falls under the integer category.
e. Percentage	                        Real	               Percentages can have fractional values (e.g., 89.5%), so they are categorized as real/float.
f. Your name	                       String	               Names are composed of text, making them strings.
g. Password	                           String	               Passwords are stored as strings because they often include letters, numbers, and symbols.
h. Email ID	                           String	               Email IDs are textual in nature and are best represented as strings.
i. Grade	                          Character	               Grades are typically represented as single characters (e.g., 'A', 'B', 'C'), so they fall under this category.
