---------------------------------------------------History of C Language-----------------------------------------------------------------

1. BCPL (Basic Combined Programming Language) was developed by Martin Richards in 1966.

2. Taking inspiration from BCPL, Ken Thompson has developed B language in 1969.Objective was to create UNIX operating system.  

3. Dennis Ritchie developed C language by making improvements in B language in 1972 at AT & Tâ€™s Bell Laboratory,New Jersy,USA.  

4. UNIX was rewritten in C language.Ritchie and Thompson are co-developers of UNIX.

5. The C programming language has a rich history that has greatly influenced modern programming languages.


*****************************************************History of C Language****************************************************************

History of C language is interesting to know. Here we are going to discuss a brief history of the c language:

1. C programming language was developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at bell laboratories of AT&T (American Telephone & Telegraph), located 
in the U.S.A.

2. Dennis Ritchie is known as the founder of the c language.

3. It was developed to overcome the problems of previous languages such as B, BCPL, etc.

4. Initially, C language was developed to be used in UNIX operating system. 
It inherits many features of previous languages such as B and BCPL.

5. Let's see the programming languages that were developed before C language:

7. ANSI/ISO C                                     1990                                                  ISO Committee

C language ke version history ko step-by-step dekhenge:

1. C Language ki Shuruat (1972):

(a). Ken Thompson aur Dennis Ritchie ne C language ko Bell Labs mein develop kiya. 
Iska pehla version BCPL (Basic Combined Programming Language) aur B language se influence tha, jo Thompson ne pehle develop kiya tha.
(b). C language ko initially "C Programming Language" ka naam diya gaya tha, 
aur iska main purpose tha ek portable aur efficient language develop karna jo UNIX ko likhne ke liye use ho sake.

2. K&R C (1978):

(a). Brian Kernighan aur Dennis Ritchie ne "The C Programming Language" book likhi, jisme pehli baar C ko define kiya gaya.
(b). Yeh version "K&R C" ke naam se jaana jaata hai, kyunki book ke authors Kernighan aur Ritchie the.
(c). K&R C mein kuch features the jo aaj ke modern C mein nahi hain, jaise ki function declarations ka use nahi hona.

3. ANSI C (1989):

(a). 1980s mein American National Standards Institute (ANSI) ne C language ke standardization pe kaam karna shuru kiya.
(b). ANSI C, jo 1989 mein official standard ban gaya, ne C language ke syntax aur semantics ko clearly define kiya.
(c). Is version mein kuch important updates aaye:
    -Function prototypes introduce kiye gaye, jisse function declarations ka syntax clear ho gaya.
    -Standard Library ko define kiya gaya, jisme important functions aur header files (like stdio.h, stdlib.h) shamil the.
    -Data types ko bhi thoda enhance kiya gaya tha.

4. C99 (1999):

(a). C99 C language ka next major standard tha jo 1999 mein release hua.
(b). Key Features:
    -Inline functions: Functions ko directly code mein insert karne ki ability.
    -New data types: Jaise ki long long int (larger integer data type).
    -Variable Length Arrays (VLA): Arrays ka size run-time pe define karna possible ho gaya.
    -Improved support for internationalization (wide characters aur multibyte characters).
    -Restrict keyword: Yeh keyword pointer optimization ko enhance karta tha.

5. C11 (2011):

(a). C11 standard 2011 mein release hua, jisme aur bhi naye features introduce kiye gaye.
(b). Key Features:
    -Thread support: Thread library add ki gayi, jo multi-threading ko support karti thi.
    -_Alignas aur _Alignof: Yeh features memory alignment ko control karte hain.
    -Static assertions: _Static_assert ka introduction, jisse compile-time pe conditions ko check kiya ja sakta tha.
    -Improved atomic operations: Concurrent programming ko support karne ke liye atomic operations ka addition.

6. C17 (2017):
(a). C17 ko C18 bhi kaha jata hai, aur yeh C language ka last officially recognized standard hai.
(b). Is version mein major updates nahi the, bas kuch bugs aur defects ko fix kiya gaya aur C11 ke features ko improve kiya gaya.
(c). Key Features:
    -Minor corrections aur improvements to the C11 standard.
    -Koi major new features nahi the, mainly backward compatibility aur optimization pe focus tha.
