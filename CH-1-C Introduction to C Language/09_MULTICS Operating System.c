-----------------------------------------------------MULTICS--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. MULTICS = Multiplexed Information and Computing Service.
Matlab ek hi computer system pe alag-alag users ka kaam ek saath handle karna.

2. MULTICS was a time-sharing operating system.

3. MULTICS was an advanced computer operating system created in the mid-1960s. It was like the "grandparent" of modern operating systems 
and introduced many ideas we still use today.

4. Its Planning and Development started in 1964.

5. MULTICS was developed in 1965.

6. MULTICS was written in PL/I (Programming Language One).

7. MULTICS was a first operating system that was developed in high-level language.

8. Initially, It was a cooperative Project led by MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) along with Bell Labs (AT&T) and General Electric (GE).
MULTICS was built by MIT, Bell Labs, and General Electric. It was first used in 1969. 
Later, Bell Labs left the project and created UNIX, which was simpler and became even more famous.

9. It was developed on the GE-645 computer. 
GE-645 Computer ek bahut hi advanced aur historic computer system tha jo General Electric (GE) ne 1960s ke dauraan design aur manufacture 
kiya tha. Iska sabse bada significance yeh hai ki yeh computer MULTICS operating system ke liye specifically develop kiya gaya tha.

10. MULTICS was a multi-user system, which means many people could use the same computer at the same time.

11. MULTICS was shut down in 2000, but its ideas live on in the systems we use today.

12. MULTICS was a very important system in the history of computing, and its ideas are still important today.


---------------------------------------------------------MULTICS kaise kaam karta tha?------------------------------------------------------

1. Ek computer, bohot saare users:
Pehle ke computers mein ek waqt mein ek hi insaan kaam kar sakta tha. 
MULTICS ne "time-sharing" ka system laya, jisme ek computer apna time tod-tod ke users ke kaam ko handle karta tha. 
Sabko lagta tha ki wo akela computer use kar raha hai.

2. Secure system:
Har user ka apna account hota tha, aur files ko password aur permissions ke saath protect kiya jaata tha. 
Matlab, aapki files sirf aap hi dekh sakte the.

3. File ka tree system:
MULTICS ne file aur folder ka "hierarchy" system invent kiya. 
Jaisa aaj hum computer mein folders ke andar subfolders aur files rakhte hain, woh idea MULTICS ka hi tha.

4. Smart memory system:
Jab computer ki physical memory (RAM) khatam ho jaati thi, MULTICS storage (hard disk) ko use karta tha, 
jis se aisa lagta tha ki memory kabhi khatam hi nahi hoti.

5. Continuous upgrades:
MULTICS ko modular design mein banaya gaya tha. 
Matlab agar nayi technology ya feature add karni ho, toh puri system ko todne ki zarurat nahi thi. Seedha naye parts add kar do.


--------------------------------------------------MULTICS ka banane wale kaun the?-----------------------------------------------------------

1. MULTICS ek team project tha jo MIT, Bell Labs, aur General Electric ke collaboration se bana.

2. MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) ne is project ko lead kiya.

3. Bell Labs (AT&T) aur General Electric (GE) bhi ismein involved the.

4. MULTICS ke developers mein se kuch famous names the:
- Fernando Corbato: MIT professor, jo MULTICS ke project leader the.
- Ken Thompson: Bell Labs ke engineer, jo baad mein UNIX banane wale the.
- Dennis Ritchie: Bell Labs ke engineer, jo UNIX ke co-developer the.

5. Bell Labs baad mein MULTICS project se alag ho gaya aur UNIX banaya, jo lightweight aur easy version tha. 
UNIX ke upar hi aaj ka Linux aur macOS based hain.
Bell Labs ne MULTICS ko "too complex" bolkar chhod diya tha. Phir unhone UNIX banaya, jo asaan aur simple tha. 
UNIX itna popular hua ki uske basis par aaj ke operating systems bane hain, jaise Linux, Android, aur macOS.


------------------------------------------------------MULTICS ke fayde kya the?---------------------------------------------------------------

1. Pehli baar log ek computer ko ek saath use kar sakte the.

2. Computers secure ho gaye; data aur files lock hone lage.

3. File system aur memory management modern ho gaya.

4. System ko continuously update karna easy ho gaya.

---------------------------------------------Aaj ke computers mein MULTICS ke concepts kaha hai?---------------------------------------------

1. File system: Windows, macOS aur Linux sab mein folders aur files ka jo tree system hai, woh MULTICS ki den hai.

2. Security: Passwords, file permissions, aur restricted access ka system MULTICS se hi aya.

3. Virtual memory: Jab system ki RAM khatam ho, toh storage ka use karke programs chalayenge, yeh idea bhi MULTICS ka tha.

4. Multi-user system: Aaj ke servers aur cloud computing ka base MULTICS ka time-sharing concept hai.
