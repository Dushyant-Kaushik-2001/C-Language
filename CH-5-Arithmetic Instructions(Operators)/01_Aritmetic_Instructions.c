--------------------------------------------------Arithmetic Instructions------------------------------------------------------------------

1. An instruction which is used to manipulate data using operators is known as arithmetic instruction. 

2. Operator requires operands (data) to perform certain operation. 
For example: 
3+4 is an expression with one operator and two operands. Operator is + and 3,4 are the operands.  

3. On the basis of number of operands required to perform operation by the operator, we can classify them as: 

(a) Unary operators = Unary operators are those which require only one operand.
(b) Binary Operators = binary operators require two operands.
(c) Ternary Operators = whereas ternary operator needs three operands to perform their tasks.

4. What matter most is the precedence of operator. When we have an expression with multiple operators in it, we have to rule out which one 
to solve first. 
In mathematics, we must know about BODMAS rule. It is simply to remember priority of operators. 

Remember: There is no BODMAS rule in C language.
Just because there are so many operators in C language, it is not that easy to remember there precedence thus we can categorize operators 
according to their behaviour as well as priority rule. It will help us to remember priority of operators.


--------------------------------------------------------Types of Operators------------------------------------------------------------------ 
1. Unary Operators.
2. Arithmetic Operators. 
3. Bitwise Operators.
4. Relational Operators.
5. Logical Operators.
6. Conditional Operator.
7. Assignment Operators.

NOTE = Unary Operator ki priority sabse jyada hai then arithmetic and so on.
Kisi operator mein agr hum ek se jyada operator dekh rhe hain to sabse phle unary operator solve kriye and so on.
