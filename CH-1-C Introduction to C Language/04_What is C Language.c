-----------------------------------------------------WHAT IS PROGRAMMING?-----------------------------------------------------------------

Computer programming is a medium for us to communicate with computers.Just like we use ‘Hindi’ or ‘English’ to communicate with each other,
programming is a way for us to deliver our instructions to the computer.


-----------------------------------------------------WHAT IS C?--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

1. C is a programming language. 
2. C is one of the oldest and finest programming languages. 
3. C was developed by Dennis Ritchie at AT&T’s Bell labs, USA in 1972.


-------------------------------------------------Why C language is so important?----------------------------------------------------------

**C language is very popular among programmers for its unique features and capabilities.Let’s first have a look to its fame: 
1. Oracle was written in C.
2. Core libraries of android are written in C.
3. MySQL is written in C.
4. Almost all device drivers are written in C.
5. Major part of web browser is written in C.
6. UNIX operating system was developed in C.
7. C language is ranked 1 on the basis of usage of language in the programming (present time).
 
These are some of the points to make we understand that C is not an outdated language.
Many students have this myth,they believe that C is out of industry,but it is not.
C is more popular in system level programming,hardware interaction,embedded systems and building core libraries of android.

**For a student C language is even more important,specially to build his career.Some of the reasons are:

1. C is important to build programming skills:
(a) If we are a beginner,C is ideal language to start with,and we can easily focus in developing our programming skills rather than getting 
confused in too many bookish concepts. 
(b) Language is just a medium of expressing our thoughts,so learning a language makes our capable to express our thoughts.
Language is for thoughts but thoughts are not depended on language.
Thinking about a solution to a particular problem is more important.
Language is required to express that solution only.
Programming is all about learning an art of developing solution to a problem.

2. C covers elementary language features of all programming language:
Language constructs are common in all programming languages like variables,data type,control statements,functions,arrays,strings,etc.
Once we have learnt all these concepts in C,it becomes easier to learn these concepts in another language.

3. Campus recruitment proces:
Companies take exams (written + interview) which may contain questions based on C language.Especially more important for fresher.

4. C is the most popular language for hardware dependent programming:
Students belongs to non-computer science branch should learn C language,because it has its part in integration with our core field.


-------------------------------------------------------Why C is known as mother language?--------------------------------------------------

C programming is considered as the base for other programming languages, that is why it is known as mother language.
It can be defined by the following ways:

1. Mother language
2. System programming language
3. Procedure-oriented programming language
4. Structured programming language
5. Mid-level programming language

1) C as a mother language:
C language is considered as the mother language of all the modern programming languages because most of the compilers, JVMs, Kernels, etc.
are written in C language, and most of the programming languages follow C syntax, for example, C++, Java, C#, etc.
It provides the core concepts like the array, strings, functions, file handling, etc. that are being used in many languages like C++, 
Java, C#, etc.

2) C as a system programming language:
A system programming language is used to create system software. C language is a system programming language because it can be used to do 
low-level programming (for example driver and kernel). It is generally used to create hardware devices, OS, drivers, kernels, etc. 
For example, Linux kernel is written in C. It can't be used for internet programming like Java, .Net, PHP, etc.

3) C as a procedural language:
A procedure is known as a function, method, routine, subroutine, etc. A procedural language specifies a series of steps for the program to
solve the problem.A procedural language breaks the program into functions, data structures, etc.
C is a procedural language. In C, variables and function prototypes must be declared before being used.

4) C as a structured programming language:
A structured programming language is a subset of the procedural language. Structure means to break a program into parts or blocks so that 
it may be easy to understand.
In the C language, we break the program into parts using functions. It makes the program easier to understand and modify.

5) C as a mid-level programming language:
C is considered as a middle-level language because it supports the feature of both low-level and high-level languages. C language program 
is converted into assembly code, it supports pointer arithmetic (low-level), but it is machine independent (a feature of high-level).
A Low-level language is specific to one machine, i.e., machine dependent. It is machine dependent, fast to run. But it is not easy to 
understand.A High-Level language is not specific to one machine, i.e., machine independent. It is easy to understand.


-------------------------------------------------------USES OF C--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
C language is used to program a wide variety of systems.Some of the uses of are as follows: 

1. Major parts of Windows, Linux and other operating systems are written in C. 
2. C is used to write driver programs for devices like tablets, printers etc. 
3. C language is used to program embedded systems where programs need to run faster in limited memory(Microwave,Cameras etc.) 
4. C is used to develop games, an area where latency is very important,i.e.,the computer must react quickly to user input.
