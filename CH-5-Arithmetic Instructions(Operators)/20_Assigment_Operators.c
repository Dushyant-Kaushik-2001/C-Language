/*
--------------------------------------------Assignment Operator (= ,+=, -=, *=, /=, %=, &=,|=, ^=)------------------------------------------
R to L

1. Assignment operator is the most used operator in the expression. 

2. It is sometimes misinterpreted as equal to operators by beginners.

3. Assignment operator is used to assign value to the variable. 

4. It is a binary operator where left operand must be a variable. 
For Example:
x = 4;                                              // Right vaali cheez hi left mein aati hai ulta nhi hota matlab 4 = x; galat hai
In this expression value 4 is assigned to the variable x.

5. Following are invalid expressions: 
4 = x;                                         // Left operand must be a variable. 
3 = 4; 
a+3 = 5; 
  
NOTE = Agr assignment ke left hand side p variable nhi hai to Error aati hai

***********************************************Compound Assignment Operators(+=, -=, *=, /=, %=, &=, |=, ^=)**********************************

int x = 5;
x += 4;         x = x + 4 
x -= 3;         x = x - 3
x *= 2;         x = x * 2
x /= 6;         x = x / 6
x %= 5;         x = x % 5
